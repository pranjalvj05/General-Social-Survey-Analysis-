# General Social Survey Analysis 

 Here , I use the General Social Survey (GSS) dataset.
 
 The work of  Gss, the General Social Survey,  is to moniter the social activities and to study the growing complexity of American Society. GSS has been working for this since 1972.
The basic purpose of this project work is to make us understand the GSS functionality and its services. And to be able to understand the statistical Problems.
