# Inferential-Statistics
by Duke University 

Identify a research question similar to questions weâ€™ve talked about in this course. Use the General Social Survey (GSS) dataset (provided below).

All analysis must be completed using the R programming language via RStudio, and your write up must be an R Markdown document. To help you get started we provide a template Rmd file below. Download this file, and fill in each section.

Your project will consist of 4 parts:

Data: (3 points) Describe how the observations in the sample are collected, and the implications of this data collection method on the scope of inference (generalizability / causality). Note that you might will need to look into documentation on the GSS to answer this question. See http://gss.norc.org/ as well as the "More information on the data" section below.
Research question: (3 points) Come up with a research question that you want to answer using these data. You should phrase your research question in a way that matches up with the scope of inference your dataset allows for. You are welcomed to create new variables based on existing ones. Along with your research question include a brief discussion (1-2 sentences) as to why this question is of interest to you and/or your audience.
EDA: (10 points) Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) that addresses the research question you outlined above. Your EDA should contain numerical summaries and visualizations. Each R output and plot should be accompanied by a brief interpretation.
Inference: (28 points) Perform inference that addresses the research question you outlined above. Each R output and plot should be accompanied by a brief interpretation.
In addition to these parts, there are also 6 points allocated to format, overall organization, and readability of your project. Total points add up to 50 points. See the assessment rubric for more details on how your peers will evaluate your work.

Your submission should be a single HTML file that results from knitting your Rmd file. This document should contain all your code, R output and plots, and your narrative. You must use the Rmd template provided in the project instructions.
